                in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh. I have a deep interest in the development field and have developed skills in
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and GitHub. I enjoy learning and growing through new experiences and
                challenges. Outside of my studies, I like to spend my time listening to music, cooking, singing, and
                exploring new skills. I believe in positivity and hard work, which guide both my personal and
                professional life..</p>
